# super_scripts v0.1.1 - 2025-12-16

## Summary
- Added `odus` integration wrapper and documentation.
- Added `visual_specs` utility (single PNG + compact JSON) with README and sample output.
- Standardized README style across modules (`hades_env_guard`, `c.ops_provisioner`, `sys_maintainer`, and main `README.md`).
- Minor tooling: made `odus.sh` and `visual_specs.py` executable and archived legacy copy of `system_specs_visual.py`.

## Notes
- `visual_specs` requires `matplotlib` and `psutil`.
- `odus` has been fully integrated into the repository under `super_scripts/odus/` (runtime scripts live in `super_scripts/odus/scripts/`).

## Contributors
- Automated edits by repo maintainer scripts (2025-12-16)
